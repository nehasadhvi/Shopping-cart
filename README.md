# Shopping-cart

<ul>
  <li>This project is mostly based on DOM Scripting and how to traverse through the HTML elements to make the web application dynamic for users</li>
  <li>You can add and remove various courses to and from the shopping cart which makes use of the local storage</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

You need to clone this repository via SSH or HTTPS link provided by GitHub using terminal :
```
git clone git@github.com:nehasadhvi/Shopping-cart.git
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/nehasadhvi/Shopping-cart.git
```

Now, after succesfully cloning the repo, to run the application on your local computer you need to open the local repo using VS Code(highly recommended) and use the "Live Server" extention to run the application on pre-defined port by live server.

This will make your application run on PORT 5500, if in use, on next available port.

Happy Shopping ! ;)
